PyKuda is a Python package designed to streamline interactions with the Kuda Bank API, making it effortless to leverage the powerful features offered by Kuda Bank. This package utilizes Kuda's API v2, providing authentication through an `API key` and a `token`. With PyKuda, developers can seamlessly integrate Kuda's banking capabilities into their applications, ensuring secure and efficient financial transactions.

## Getting started

### Install PyKuda

To use this package, install it using the package manager [pip](https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/):

```bash
pip install pykuda
```

Our package, PyKuda has some dependencies that will be installed (requests and python-decouple). `requests` is used by PyKuda to make HTTP requests to Kuda's endpoints, while the `python-decouple` is responsible for getting the environmental variables that have to be set for the requests to be authenticated; more to be discussed below.

### Create Environmental variables

After installation, the next thing is to create a `.env` file where the environmental variables will be stored. Five variables are to be set in the `.env` file, shown in an example below.


```shell
KUDA_KEY="Your Kuda Api Key"
TOKEN_URL="https://kuda-openapi.kuda.com/v2.1/Account/GetToken" # Kuda API v2.1 GetToken URL
REQUEST_URL="https://kuda-openapi.kuda.com/v2.1/" # Kuda API v2.1 Request URL
EMAIL="Your email used to register for the Kuda account"
MAIN_ACCOUNT_NUMBER="Your main Kuda account number"
```

Not setting these in the `.env` file will raise a value error as shown below.

```shell
>>> from pykuda.pykuda import PyKuda
>>> kuda = PyKuda()
Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "<stdin>", line 1, in <module>
  File "/path/to/Python/version/lib/python/site-packages/pykuda/pykuda.py", line 16, in __init__
    raise ValueError(response)
ValueError: TOKEN_URL, REQUEST_URL, EMAIL, MAIN_ACCOUNT_NUMBER are not set, please set them in the environment or pass them as a dictionary when initializing PyKuda.
```

NB: Please ensure you do not push your `.env` file to public repositories as the details here are confidential.

### Initialize with credentials

If you do not want to set the credentials in the `.env` file, you can also initialize `PyKuda` with a dictionary of your credentials.

```shell
>>> from pykuda.pykuda import PyKuda
>>> credentials = {
...   "KUDA_KEY": "KUDA_KEY",
...   "TOKEN_URL": "TOKEN_URL",
...   "REQUEST_URL": "REQUEST_URL",
...   "EMAIL": "EMAIL",
...   "MAIN_ACCOUNT_NUMBER": "MAIN_ACCOUNT_NUMBER",
... }
>>> kuda = PyKuda(credentials) # Will not raise a ValueError

```

## Using PyKuda

### Successful request

```python
from pykuda.pykuda import PyKuda

kuda = PyKuda()
response = kuda.banks_list()
print(response)
# Example Response:
# PyKudaResponse(status_code=200, data=[list_of_banks], error=False)
```

### Failed request

In case the request isn't successful, the PyKudaResponse will be different. The data will be a `Response` Object which you can check to investigate the cause (Maybe your Token is not correct, or the URL, or something else). Now, let's say the API Key in the `.env` file was not the correct one, and a request was made, the example below shows the response to expect.

```python
print(response)
# PyKudaResponse(status_code=401, data=<Response [401]>, error=True)

print(response.data.text)
# 'Invalid Credentials'

print(response.data.reason)
# 'Unauthorized'
```

### Understanding PyKudaResponse

With `PyKuda`, every interaction with the Kuda API is elevated through the `PyKudaResponse` object, enriching the responses from Kuda. This custom response encapsulates three key attributes: `status_code`, `data`, and `error`.

`PyKudaResponse` serves as a tailored feedback mechanism provided by PyKuda. Its primary purpose is to enhance the interpretation of Kuda's responses and reliably confirm the success of a request. In cases where the request encounters issues, the `error` attribute is set to `True`, signaling that an error has occurred during the interaction. This nuanced approach ensures a more robust and dependable handling of API responses. It is imperative to systematically inspect the `error` attribute to ascertain the success of the method.

**Example:**
This illustrative example outlines a conventional approach to leveraging PyKuda for verifying a request's success.

```python
import logging

from rest_framework.response import Response
from rest_framework.views import APIView
from rest_framework import status

from pykuda.pykuda import PyKuda


logger = logging.getLogger(__name__)

# Initialize PyKuda instance
kuda = PyKuda()

class BanksListView(APIView):
    """
    API view to retrieve a list of banks.
    """

    def get(self, request) -> Response:
        """
        Handle GET request to retrieve a list of banks.

        Returns:
            Response: JSON response containing the list of banks or an error message.
        """
        # Retrieve the list of banks from Kuda API
        response = kuda.banks_list()

        if not response.error:
            # The request was successful
            # Return the list of banks to the frontend
            return Response(response.data, status=response.status_code)
        else:
            # There was an error in the request
            # Log provider error details
            self.log_kuda_error(response.data)
            # Return an error and handle it in the frontend or according to your business model
            return Response("Your custom error", status="error_code")

    def log_kuda_error(self, error_response: PyKudaResponse) -> None:
        """
        Log details of Kuda API error.

        Args:
            error_response (PyKudaResponse): The PyKudaResponse object containing error details.
        """

        # Log error details
        logger.error(
            f"KUDA ERROR: \n"
            f"STATUS CODE - {error_response.status_code} \n"
            f"RESPONSE DATA - {error_response.data} \n"
            f"ERROR - {error_response.error}"
        )
```

As seen above, the PyKudaResponse returns the `status_code`, `data`, and `error`; the data attribute already contains the appropriate data received from Kuda API. You can access the Kuda response data by executing `response.data`.

#### Important Note on Error Handling:

When interacting with the Kuda API, it is not recommended to rely solely on the `status_code` for error handling. The Kuda API may return a `200` status code even in cases where Kuda couldn't process the request due to client errors or typos.

For instance, when attempting to purchase airtime, passing an invalid `tracking_reference` will return a `200` status code from Kuda, but the request will not be processed successfully.

To ensure robust error handling, it is crucial to examine the response data and utilize the error attribute in the `PyKudaResponse` object. `PyKuda` intelligently checks that if the request is not successful and was not processed by Kuda, the `PyKudaReponse.error` will be `True`. This `error` attribute indicates whether the API request was successful or if there were issues.

**Example:**

```python
response = kuda.virtual_account_purchase_bill(
    amount='10000',
    kuda_biller_item_identifier="KD-VTU-MTNNG",
    customer_identifier="08030001234",
    tracking_reference="invalid_tracking_reference", # Invalid tracking_reference
)

print(response)
# PyKudaResponse(status_code=200, data=<Response [200]>, error=True)
print(response.data.text)
# '{"message": "Invalid Virtual Account.","status": false, "data": null, "statusCode": "k-OAPI-07"}'
```

As shown in the [Successful request](#successful-request) section, it is recommended to use `PyKudaResponse.error` to ensure that the request was successful.

## What else can PyKuda do?

`PyKuda` can be used to make other requests also. Below are examples of how to use the other methods available in the `ServiceType` class.

    middle_name="Middle",
    business_name="ABC Ltd",
)
print(response)
# Example Response:
# PyKudaResponse(status_code=200, data=<response_data>, error=False)

print(response.data)
